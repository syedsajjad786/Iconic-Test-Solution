The solution contains the files used for creating the model and the outputs.

Here is the brief information about each file.

2) data.json.zip (The file used for building the model. The data was provided by iconic).
3) Iconic_Data_Science_Test_R_File.R ( The R code used to generate R Markdown file).
4) Iconic_Data_Science_Test_Markdown.Rmd (The R Markdown File with code explanation).
5) Iconic_Data_Science_Test_Markdown.html (The HTML file generated by R Markdown).
6) Detailed Model Technical Explanation.html ( The Random Forest Model detailed technical explanation output file).
7) Detailed Explanation of the process.docx (Explanation of the Process and insights).
8) Executive Summary.docx (The summary of the project and outcomes).
9) Iconic_Test_Data_Clean_Clusters.csv (The Clustering file that was generated by the K-Means)



I have used the files downloaded in my system for modelling. I was using both Mac and Windows for building the Model. 
I have provided the file path samples for Mac and Windows. You have to replace the file path with file path in your system.
